## GOAL

For Fun!

I am going on vacation and wanted a place to store all my numbers and contact information.

During the process of printing out all of the paper work with confirmation codes, also downloading movies 
for my 2 year old son to watch, I thought it would be fun to create a simple jQueryMobile application.

So at about 10am on a saturday, I started with just a simple sinatra app connecting to simple db.

Then I hit a wall of frustration with Simple DB and the Data Layer, this was mainly my inexperience 
with the way simple db stores collections.  So I thought, I wonder how long it would take me to do this 
app in rails.  I started about 2pm and after working a couple of hours, I got a working app and have had
a blast fine tuning it.

Rails 3 has definitely made it fun and quick again to hack on little apps with rails.
